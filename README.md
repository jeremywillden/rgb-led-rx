# rgb-led-rx
Raspberry Pi Pico PIO receiver for addressable RGB LED data streams

I built this to enable translation between different RGB LED string protocols.  It enables hardware-timed reception of WS2812 / Neopixel or other similar protocols so the data can be received, processed, stored, modified, or re-transmitted in a different format.
